## ABOUT ME
Myself Mohammed Rishad Ali,a final year mechanical engineering student pursuing my graduation from MES college of engineering, Kuttipuram.
My native place is Pattambi of Palakkad District.<br>
This blog is to share my fablab experiences.<br>

## WHAT IS FABLAB?<br>
![fablab](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Fab_Lab_logo.svg/269px-Fab_Lab_logo.svg.png "fablab")


A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make “almost anything”. This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production. A FabLab is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention.<br>
It was created by an American professor at MIT, Neil Gershenfield.

Students at the FabLab learn:
 - how to use a Fab Lab’s digital fabrication tools for rapid prototyping
 - Epilog Mini Lasercutter
 - 3D printer
 - Roland Desktop Vinyl Cutter
 - ShopBot
 - electronics design and production by producing circuit boards using a variety of sensors and output devices.
 - molding and casting
 - 3D scanning and printing
 
A minimum knowledge of the following tools and processes is required:
- 2D and 3D modeling
- Digital fabrication
- Electronics programming
 
## FABLAB @ MESCE
 ![fablab](https://alirezanv.github.io/LAB.jpg "fablab")<br>
FabLab at MESCE, Kuttippuram is one of the 20 mini fablabs in kerala and the only fab lab in the Malabar region  where the students have the oppurtunity to explore FAB world.
A training session was conducted for the students of the college inorder to make us familirized with the machines and to provide a hands-on workshop on the same . We got familiarized with the following machines during the training period.

### 3D PRINTER<br>

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object.Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. STL is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read. Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.

### How to 3D print ?

* STEP 1 
<h4>Design the prototype</h4>
First of all you need to design the prototype using any of the appropriate softwares such as Rhinoceros, AutoCAD, Solidworks etc. to turn your 2D design to a 3D model.So the first step is to design the image using any appropriate software and then save the image in stl format.<br>
The below image shows my design to 3D print a mobile stand.<br>

* STEP 2
<h4>Convert STL file to Gcode</h4>
This can be done using the Cura software.The design stl file is opened in Cura to generate the gcode.
In Cura we can select the nozzle and material needed and specify the quality needed for the object ( 20%, 50%, 100% etc) depending on the strength required for the design.The Cura tell us how much time it would take to print the object.<br>
Now click “Save to file” and generate the gcode<br>
>What is G-code?
GCode is the generic name for a control language for CNC (or Reprap) machines. It is a way for you to tell the machine to move to various points at a desired speed, control the spindle speed, turn on and off various coolants, and all sorts of other things. It is fairly standard, and is a useful tool.<br>

* STEP 3
<h4>Feed the Gcode file to the 3D printer</h4>
Now your Gcode file is ready to be fed to the 3D printer. Export the file to the memory card that can be inserted into the 3D printer.Then select the file from the memory card.Now 3D printer starts printing your design layer by layer.<br>

* STEP 4
<h4>The Final Product</h4>
Once the printing is over, wait for the product to cooldown.Then remove it from the printer.<br>

### VINYL CUTTING<br>
![vinyl](https://shaheer08.github.io/v8.jpg "vinyl")<br>
A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).A vinyl cutter (or vinyl plotter) is a computer-controlled plotting device with a blade instead of a pen. A vector based design is created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) and then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable.<br>

### How to use vinyl cutting machine?

* STEP 1
<h4>Create your design</h4>
Create your design or find an image and open it in the CutStudio software.Right click and select trace of the image outline. Change the size as required and press enter key.<br>
* STEP 2
<h4>Set the machine</h4> 
When the design is ready to be cut,load a roll or a piece of vinyl into the machine and adjust the wheels. Next pull the lever to hold down the vinyl. Then turn the machine on and select roll if your using a roll or select piece if your using a piece.<br>
* STEP 3
<h4>Cutting</h4>
When it is all set.Go into CutStudio and click "Cutting". A window will pop up and you wanna click "ok" but when you click "ok" you have to hit enter on the vinyl cutter.After cutting Use masking tape to peel out the neccesary part then stick your design onto whatever you want.
