## ABOUT ME
Myself Mohammed Rishad Ali,a final year mechanical engineering student pursuing my graduation from MES college of engineering, Kuttipuram.
My native place is Pattambi of Palakkad District.<br>
This blog is to share my fablab experiences.<br>

## WHAT IS FABLAB?<br>
![fablab](http://www.scuolaetecnologia.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/fablab.jpg "fablab")


A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make “almost anything”. This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production. A FabLab is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention.<br>
It was created by an American professor at MIT, Neil Gershenfield.

Students at the FabLab learn:
 - how to use a Fab Lab’s digital fabrication tools for rapid prototyping
 - Epilog Mini Lasercutter
 - 3D printer
 - Roland Desktop Vinyl Cutter
 - ShopBot
 - electronics design and production by producing circuit boards using a variety of sensors and output devices.
 - molding and casting
 - 3D scanning and printing
 
A minimum knowledge of the following tools and processes is required:
- 2D and 3D modeling
- Digital fabrication
- Electronics programming
 
## FABLAB @ MESCE

FabLab at MESCE, Kuttippuram is one of the 20 mini fablabs in kerala and the only fab lab in the Malabar region  where the students have the oppurtunity to explore FAB world.
A training session was conducted for the students of the college inorder to make us familirized with the machines and to provide a hands-on workshop on the same . We got familiarized with the following machines during the training period.

### 3D PRINTER<br>

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object.Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. STL is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read. Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.
