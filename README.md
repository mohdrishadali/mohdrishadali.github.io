A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make “almost anything”. This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production.<br>
It was created by an American professor at MIT, Neil Gershenfield.
